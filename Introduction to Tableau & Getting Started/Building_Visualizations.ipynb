        "Visualizations in Tableau are key to understanding the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in your data. To create effective visualizations, you need to follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand Your Data: Before you start plotting, know what data you are working with, its structure (dimensions vs. measures), and what kind of insights you want to derive.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Select the Right Visualization Type: Different types of visualizations are used for different kinds of analysis. Univariate analysis is for understanding individual distributions, bivariate for relationships between two variables, and multivariate for analyzing multiple variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Plot the Data: Start by dragging the fields into Tableau’s rows, columns, and filters shelves. These actions will determine the type of visualization you get.\n",
